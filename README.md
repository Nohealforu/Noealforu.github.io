*** IDEA BEING RESEARCHED VERSION 0.0.0 *** Mapping tool for Final Fantasy 1 (NES). Allows walking around to make paths or free scrolling on maps. Record mode or drag and drop mode to create paths. Save paths to local/browser storage or export. Share paths with other users online (???) Future ideas include step route mapping, automatic encounter mapping that handles resets or single segment, etc.
